## Why work with maps?  

Over the last two years, a number of students have included "spacial analysis" as part of the professional project proposals. Examples include:

- prevalence of lead in blood samples, compared by zip codes 
- examination of lead in municipal water samples 
- mapping the spatial patterns of the salt through time and the geospatial resources of the greater Bonneville Salt Flats research initiative
- evaluating the effectiveness of a watershed restoration plan
- trail activity and its effects on Flammulated Owl breeding populations in Snow Basin Utah

## What are my options?  

Fortunately, there are several options available to display 

- **ggplot2 Esentials** (Chapter 7: ggplot2 and maps)
- [Making Maps with R](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/lectures/making-maps-with-R.html)
- [**ggmap : Spatial Visualization with ggplot2**] (http://stat405.had.co.nz/ggmap.pdf)


## Example of a common map (USGS)

Map details can be found at https://water.usgs.gov/watuse/wups.html  

## Example of a common map (PSM)

## Overview of packages used for maps

We will need the flolloiwng librarys to start  

```{r echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # this installs ggplot2 and other tidyverse pacakges

library(maps) # draw geograhpical maps

# install.packages("mapdata")
library(mapdata) # additional high resolution outlines (you may need to install the pacakge first)
```


## What is in the "maps"" pacakge

Currently available maps[^1]  
- world: This is a map of the entire world  
- usa: This is a map of the US coast  
- state: This is a map of the USA at the state level  
- county: This is a map of the USA at the county level  
- italy: This is a map of Italy  
- france: This is a map of France  
- nz: This is a map of New Zealand

## When possible, work with tidy data  
Orginal dataset:    
```{r echo=TRUE}
head(us.cities)
```

## Convert to tidy dat (let's just assume that it will help later)  
Tidy dataset:  
```{r}
us_cities <- as.tibble(us.cities)
us_cities
```
